View:
A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of a SELECT statement.
It does not store data physically but dynamically retrieves data from its underlying base tables every time it is queried, essentially acting as a stored query.

Key points:
1.Doesn't store data itself
2. Fetches data from underlying tables
3. Can simplify complex queries
4. Provides data abstraction and security

SYNTAX:
Create a View
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Ex:
show databases;
use practices;
show tables;

CREATE VIEW student_details AS
SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM students
WHERE status = 'active';

SELECT * FROM student_details;
