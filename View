View:
A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of a SELECT statement.
It does not store data physically but dynamically retrieves data from its underlying base tables every time it is queried, essentially acting as a stored query.

Key points:
1.Doesn't store data itself
2. Fetches data from underlying tables
3. Can simplify complex queries
4. Provides data abstraction and security

SYNTAX:
Create a View
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Ex:
show databases;
use practices;
show tables;

CREATE VIEW student_details AS
SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM students
WHERE status = 'active';
SELECT * FROM student_details;



Table:
A table is a collection of related data in a database, consisting of rows (records) and columns (fields).

Key points:
1.Stores data in a structured format
2.Each row is a unique record
3. Each column represents a field or attribute

Syntax:
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 datatype constraints,
  column2 datatype constraints,
  ...
);




Ex:
show databases;
use practices;
show tables;

CREATE TABLE students (
  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);


INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name, email) 
VALUES (1, 'Chandra', 'Mouli', 'chandramouli.com');

SELECT * FROM students;


SELECT * FROM student_details;
